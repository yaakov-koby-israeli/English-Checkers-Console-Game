# English Checkers Console Game
A console-based implementation of English Checkers (Draughts), developed in C#.NET. The game features two modes: a two-player mode and a single-player mode against a basic AI opponent. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, game logic implementation, and the use of data structures for board representation. The user interface is text-based, rendering the board and moves directly in the console.
