# English Checkers Console Game
A console-based implementation of English Checkers (Draughts), developed in C#.NET. The game features two modes: a two-player mode and a single-player mode against a basic AI opponent. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, game logic implementation, and the use of Data structures for board representation. The user interface is text-based, rendering the board and moves directly in the console.

  <br>  score is calculated in each round's end as the difference between the players' remaining checkers on board (regular checker = 1 points ; king = 4 points) and is granted to the winner, or to both players if round ends with a tie.<br>
